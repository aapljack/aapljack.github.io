title: Interview with Toy Story 3 Screenwriter Michael Arndt
---
My fascination with screenwriting is rooted in my love for movies. I love hearing all about the process of how movies are made. The [Creative Screenwriting podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/creative-screenwriting-magazine/id77837603) consistently delivers on this aspect of filmmaking in droves. [Jeff Goldsmith](https://twitter.com/yogoldsmith) is an excellent interviewer and his knowledge of film and the business of Hollywood always shines through in his questions.

Once a new Pixar film is released, I immediately look forward to when Jeff posts a podcast with the screenwriter. It is always a treat to hear about the inner workings of Pixar and get a little glimpse of their process and what goes in to making such great films. In the past, Jeff has interviewed [Pete Docter and Bob Peterson for **Up**](https://creativescreenwritingmagazine.blogspot.com/2009/10/pete-docter-bob-peterson-up-q.html) and [Andrew Stanton for **Wall-E**](https://creativescreenwritingmagazine.blogspot.com/2008/12/andrew-stanton-wall-e-q.html).

This week Jeff interviews Michael Arndt who is the screenwriter of **Toy Story 3**. Michael talks about his start as a script-reader for Matthew Broderick and how he quit his day job to write screenplays full-time. This paid off when he sold Little Miss Sunshine and soon after that movie started to get made, Pixar called him in to work on **Toy Story 3**.

If you love movies and love hearing about the process that goes into creating them from the page to the screen, this podcast is for you. [You can listen to this episode here](https://creativescreenwritingmagazine.blogspot.com/2010/10/michael-arndt-toy-story-3.html).
